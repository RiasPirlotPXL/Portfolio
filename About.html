                    Me as a digital designer, am responsible for creating visual content that communicates messages through digital media. This can include website design, app design, social media graphics, digital advertisements, etc.

                    To be a successful digital designer, you need to have a strong understanding of design principles, color theory, typography, and user experience (UX) design. You should also be familiar with industry-standard design tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. As also known coding languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

                    In addition to technical skills, it's important to be able to collaborate effectively with other members of a team, including developers, copywriters, and project managers. You should also stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies to ensure that your work is modern and relevant.

                    Beside being a digital designer, I'm into digital branding. This refers to the process of building and promoting a brand through digital channels such as websites, social media platforms, email marketing, online advertising, and other digital mediums.
                    In order to create a strong digital brand, companies need to establish a clear brand identity that is consistent across all digital channels. This includes developing a visual style guide, messaging and tone of voice, and a content strategy that reflects the brand's values and goals.

                    It's also important to use digital analytics to measure the effectiveness of a brand's digital marketing efforts and make data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns.

                    Overall, digital branding is an essential part of building a successful brand in today's digital landscape.
